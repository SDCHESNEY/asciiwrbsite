# About ASCII Site

ASCII Site celebrates terminal-first storytelling with production-ready Blazor components, minimal APIs, and a curl-friendly experience. The project balances nostalgia with modern engineering practices so that every release is observable, secure, and easy to deploy.

The roadmap targets:

- Consistent ASCII hero art rendered in browsers and plain text.
- Markdown-driven content, so writers can update copy with a pull request.
- GitHub showcase cards that mix ANSI vibes with live repository stats.
- Deployment scripts for Azure or GCP that prove the site can run anywhere Docker does.

Have an idea? Update `content/about.md` and run `dotnet test --configuration Release` to make sure the new story ships safely.
